This project is unusually difficult.  
I recommend reading my solution in proj3x.c, and copying the code into your project.

For proj3x.c, I mostly copied the solution from the official answer on the book's support website.
The reason this project is difficult is because the author gives almost no guidance on how to implement the solution, and many solutions are possible.  Also, reading and understanding the logic in the answer will help you to recognize these types of uses of loops and conditionals and 2D arrays.

If you have difficult with this, we can go over it together.
FYI - it took me an hour to understand and type the solution, which was mostly copied from the official solution.
